Jamalaide Website
=================

This is the website for *Jamalaide*, a club at The University of Adelaide that aims to increase interest and activity in game design and development by running 
game jams and other social events. A game jam is an event where participants attempt to design and create games (depending on the event, can be digital or 
non-digital) within a short time period (typically 24 or 48 hours).

The website (<http://www.jamalaide.org.au>) is made using Django and runs on Google App Engine. Planned features include:

 * Library of games from past jams, searchable by author, jam, awards, etc.
 * Registration for future jams
 * Information on futher development on games after jams
 * Forums for discussion of game design and development, both relating to jams and in general
 * User created tutorials
