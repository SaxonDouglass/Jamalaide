  <p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare 22</a> inbound, let's
     get a posse. On the 15th of December the droogs will meet in the Hub to jam
     it down. I have been informed that there will be no posse or droogs, but I'm
     going to be in the Hub at 1200 anyway. On a more sombre note, we are also
     hoping to run a <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> site
     in late January and are currently in discussion with the organisers.</p>

  <p>Shiny! Check out our sexy new digs with purple trim and extra topping.
  We'll be riding our art mule hard to bring you some succulent retro graphics
  which will probably be too rubbish to use, but keep your F5 key hot anyway!</p>

  <h2>Adelaide Game Jam Over</h2>
  <p class="date">2011-11-20</p>
  <p>After thirty two hours the participants stumbled out of the Clubs Association,
     clutching their hard-earned tim-tams and shambling off to find a place to
     rest. Big and/or biggest props to Colin for showering us in Adelaide Game
     Jam decals from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/colincapurso">his sticker
     shoppe</a>. We were really surprised by the quality of the entries; some of
     them were actually playable!</p>
